# codes can be found in folder 'code'
# For Poisson's equation and Wave equation, you can directly run the codes in forward problem and then use the generated data to solve the inverse problem
# For Thermal_Stress_Analysis, you need to use data in both forward and inverse problem
# data for Thermal_Stress_Analysis can be found in  folder 'data'
#The results for forward problem can be found in folder 'result' 

#Usage: install the packages in requirement.txt and then run the code in each folder
